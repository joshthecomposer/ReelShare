# SoundFlask.io
This is a reel creation and sharing app for composers and producers.
### Objectives:
* User can create multiple reels which contain multiple audio files. Each reel's view page will have a 4 digit pin, allowing the user to curate each reel to certain clients.
* Audio upload
* Client can view reels they have links to without logging in, they just need the 4 digit pin.
* Client can comment and leave notes on specific audio files in the reels for the composer to know what they enjoy for their particular interests
* Tracking of playback start and stop (probably stored as a float and converted to time) so the composer knows when the client stopped listening to the audio.
* Tracking of when a client looks at a reel, taken from their current time most likely.
